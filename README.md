This web application incorporates various libraries to create a visual and audible experience 
for the user. Alpha keys on a keyboard generate a sound and color when pressed. The keypress
generates circles in random locations. The circles fade away as the audio plays and there is
a subtle change in the color's hue as it fades.

This projects uses the following JS libraries:
